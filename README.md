# Wall

This is the base repository for the Wall programming language, a language that I would like to help implement one day.

Before working on the language itself, I've decided to write its [documentation](https://wall-lang.netlify.com).  The idea is to only implement the language if enough people are interested and find the project useful.  The documentation is meant to be read sequentially, but if you are wondering "Why Wall?", you can start [here](https://wall-lang.netlify.com/musings.html).

Please feel free to report any issues or questions about the documentation in the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/mikesol/wall/issues) or make a [pull request](https://www.github.com/mikesol/wall/pulls) if you'd like to make a contribution.  Even if you just have a few words of encouragement or a suggestion, it'd be really helpful to see it on the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/mikesol/wall/issues).
