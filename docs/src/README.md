# Wall

This is the documentation for the Wall programming language.

## What is Wall?

Wall is a statically-typed dialect of Lisp with inferred types, dependent types and duck typing. It features a compiler, an interpreter and plugins for various editors.

Wall is a good fit for programmers that work a lot with asynchronous IO and enjoy a functional style.  Its closest relative from the Lisp family is Scheme, but it also takes inspiration from TypeScript, F*, Idris and Haskell.

## What is this document?

This document provides a gentle introduction to Wall, built very much the way the language is itself.  We recommend reading it sequentially.  In it, there are ample links to reference materials for further exploration.

## Where is Wall?

The source code for Wall is under active development on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mikesol/wall).
