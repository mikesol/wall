# Wall

This is the documentation for the Wall programming language.

## What is Wall?

Wall is a dialect of Lisp that keeps track of functions' potential domains and ranges at compile time, throwing compile errors if a function is invoked with a value that is potentially outside of its range. Wall's closest relatives from the Lisp family are Scheme and Clojure, but it also takes inspiration from TypeScript, F*, Idris, Haskell, Erlang and Lua.

## What is this document?

This document provides a gentle introduction to Wall, built very much the way the language is itself.  We recommend reading it sequentially.  In it, there are ample links to reference materials for further exploration.
