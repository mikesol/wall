This is the documentation for the Wall programming language.

## What is wall

Wall is a statically-typed language with inferred types, dependent types and duck typing. It features a compiler, a transpiler, an interpreter and a VS Code plugin for realtime debugging.

Wall is a good fit for programmers that work a lot with asynchronous IO and enjoy a functional style.  Its closest relatives are Scheme, TypeScript, F*, Idris and Haskell.
