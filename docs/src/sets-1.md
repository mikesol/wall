# Sets I

Sets are constructed with square brackets preceded by a colon. Elements are separated by one or more whitespaces.  Sets can contain anything in Wall.  Since we have already seen symbols, we'll use some for demonstration purposes.

```
w> apple banana pear =
w> :[ apple banana pear ]
:[ apple banana pear ]
```
