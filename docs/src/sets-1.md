# Sets I

Sets are the fundamental building block of everything useful in Wall.  They are constructed with square brackets, and elements are separated by one or more whitespaces.  Sets can contain anything in Wall.  Since we have already seen symbols, we'll use some for demonstration purposes.

```
w> apple =
w> banana =
w> pear =
w> [ apple banana pear ]
[ apple banana pear ]
```
